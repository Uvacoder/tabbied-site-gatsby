## Notes
See tabbied_homepage_specs folder and open up index.html to see measurements and specs. The layout is on a grid of 12 columns with 82px columns and 32px gutters. Look at tabbied_homepage_grid.jpg to see the grid. This is for large desktops. I thought it would be best to start with a large layout and scale down. Also, I tried to use 8px grid system (paddings, margins, dimensions of elements) so it scales well across all devices."
